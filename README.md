Design notes
-Leartes does more damage on average since he's canonically the stronger swordman
-Hamlet dies in every ending, demonstrates his inaction
-Multiple possible lines for "Kill King" action demonstrates all the times he failed to kill the king
-Kill king doesn't actually work, Hamlet hesitates just like in the play
-Opening dialogue mirrors the play
-Warning the queen initiates the drink dialogue, this is a little different from the main play since in the play it's the king that warns gertrude
